                                  TXTDT

Simple program to read the DVD Video Manager Text Data or VMG_TXTDT_MG. This is a very 
old project. Tt was coded when I was contemplating writing my own FOSS DVD authoring 
software. Since it was to be GPLed it could not use any proprietary info. The 
TXTDT structure therefore had to be reverse engineered from scratch looking at the 
IFO file in a hex editor. I posted my program and my findings on the net so other projects
could use it but I thought  I would  gather it here for prosperity. NOTE: This is 
early alpha type software and  don't blame me for buffer problems, memory leaks etc.. 

It's simple to use just compile and then run txtdt -n VIDEO_TS.IFO and the txt data
will be like extracted like this:


dyna@bamse:~/Development/DVD/txtdt.init$ ./txtdt -n ../VIDEO_TS.IFO.2
